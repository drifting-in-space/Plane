# Plane API

The controller in Plane serves an HTTP/JSON API, which is used both by other Plane components and other trusted components
(such as your own application web server) to interact with Plane.

The Plane API is partitioned into two parts:
- A **control API** which trusted clients can use to control aspects of Plane, such as starting and terminating backends.
- A **public API** which can be used by trusted or untrusted clients alike (including your app end-users’ browsers).

The control API is served with the `/ctrl` prefix, and the public API is served with the `/pub` prefix. For flexibility,
Plane itself does not implement any access control or TLS termination on these endpoints. If you intend to expose Plane's API
over the open internet, you should use a reverse proxy (like Nginx, Caddy, or Envoy) to terminate TLS and implement access
control for each path prefix.

## Connect API

One way to think about Plane is that it acts like a distributed key-value store, except that instead of storing data associated
with each key, it manages a running process for each key. When you ask Plane for the process associated with a key, Plane
ensures that a process is running for that key, and returns a URL that points to it.

In the key-value map analogy, the default behavior of Plane is comparable to “get or create” semantics that some key-value maps
implement (such as [`setdefault`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=setdefault#dict.setdefault) in Python).

The `connect` API is the endpoint that implements this behavior.
