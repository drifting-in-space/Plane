# Connection Authorization

When you issue a successful [connect request](../plane-api.mdx#connect-api), Plane returns
a URL that can be used to route traffic to that particular backend.

Such a URL might look like this:

```
http://plane.mysite.com/tYVHfS4PKgufdhwGCnn6LLfAaCo_iAHitbw4Bg8ETjA/
```

The random-looking string in the path is a **connection token**. It tells the Plane
proxy which backend to route traffic to. Treat the connection token like a bearer token, because
any client that knows it can access the backend.

<Callout type="info">
    One of the design goals of Plane is to allow you to keep authorization logic in one place, your
    primary application backend.
</Callout>

The use of connection tokens allows you to delegate backend access business logic to
your own application backend. Typically, the way it works is:

- A user of your application performs an action that requires a session backend, such as opening a new
  document or starting a notebook session.
- In your (traditional; non-session) app backend, you verify (usually with a cookie) that the user who
  needs to access the backend is authenticated and authorized to access that backend, based on your
  application’s access control business logic.
- If the user is authorized, you issue a [connect request](../plane-api.mdx#connect-api) API call to Plane,
  resulting in a **connection token** (a tokenized URL for connecting to the backend).
- You return the connection token to the user’s browser, which then connects to the backend via
  the connection token (using `fetch(...)`, `new WebSocket(...)`, etc.)

## Associating data with a connection token

You can also associate other information with a connection token, such as the username
on whose behalf the connection token was generated. This can be done by passing a
string as the `user` field of the [connect request](../plane-api.mdx#connect-api).

You can also specify a JSON object that can be used to associate other arbitrary data
with a connection token. This is passed as the optional `auth` field of the
connect request.
