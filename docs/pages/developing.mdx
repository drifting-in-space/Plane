# Developing Plane

<Callout type="warning">
    This page and its subpages describe **modifying Plane itself**, not developing applications
    that use Plane.
    
    If you want to build applications that use Plane, see the [API reference](plane-api.mdx).
</Callout>

## Requirements

In order to run Plane locally for development, you will need a Linux or Mac OS machine with
Rust and Docker installed.

Follow [these instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust, and
[these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

## Running locally

The [quickstart guide](quickstart-guide.mdx) describes a simple way to run Plane locally
using Docker Compose. By default, this will pull a build of Plane from our container
repository, but you can also build a version from the repo source (including any changes
you’ve made locally) by running:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build
```

You can also use the `--build` flag when running `docker compose up` to build the image,
like this:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Instead of building a Docker image for each change, you can also use the `dev/*.sh` scripts
to run Plane directly from the source code. In different terminals, run:

```bash
./dev/postgres.sh && ./dev/controller.sh
```

```bash
./dev/drone.sh
```

```bash
./dev/proxy.sh
```

Each of these scripts will build (if changed) and run the appropriate component of Plane. The
components are configured similarly to how they are in the Dockerfile, so they can be accessed
with `./dev/cli.sh` in the same way.

## Running tests

Individual tests in Plane’s integration test suite can take tens of seconds to run, so while it
is possible to run them with `cargo test --all`, it is better to ues a test runner like `nextest` that
supports parallel execution. To install `nextest`, run:

```bash
cargo install nextest
```

Then, to run the tests, run:

```bash
cargo nextest run -j 8
```

The `-j` flag specifies the number of tests to run in parallel. Since the tests are IO-bound
rather than CPU-bound, you can run more tests in parallel than you have CPU cores.

As is standard with Rust, Plane has unit tests alongside the code itself (conditionally compiled 
with `#[cfg(test)]` blocks), as well as integration tests in the `tests` directory.

Since the unit tests can be slow to run, you may want to run only the unit tests. This can be
done by passing the `--lib` flag, whether using `cargo test` or `nextest`:

```bash
cargo test --lib
```
