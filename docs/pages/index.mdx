Plane is a distributed system for **running stateful WebSocket backends at scale**. Plane is heavily inspired by [Figmaâ€™s multiplayer infrastructure](https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/), which dynamically spawns a process for each active document.

Use cases include:
- Scaling up [authoritative multiplayer backends](https://jamsocket.com/blog/you-might-not-need-a-crdt).
- Running isolated code environments (like REPLs, code notebooks, and LLM agent sandboxes).
- Data-intensive applications that need a dedicated high-RAM process for each active user session.

## Architecture Overview

See the [architecture guide](concepts/architecture.mdx) for a detailed explanation of each component.
