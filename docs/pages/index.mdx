Plane is infrastructure software for **running stateful WebSocket backends at scale**. Plane is heavily inspired by [Figmaâ€™s mulitplayer infrastructure](https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/), which dynamically spawns a process for each active document.

Use cases include:
- Scaling up [authoritative multiplayer backends](https://driftingin.space/posts/you-might-not-need-a-crdt).
- Running isolated code environments (like REPLs, code notebooks, and LLM agent sandboxes).
- Data-intensive applications that need a dedicated high-RAM process for each active user session.

## Getting Started

- Jump in with the [quickstart guide](/quickstart-guide.mdx).
- Familiarize yourself with the [concepts](/concepts/session-backends.mdx) and architecture used in Plane.
